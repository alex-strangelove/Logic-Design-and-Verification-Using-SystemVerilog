# Logic Design and Verification Using SystemVerilog

This repository contains my solutions and practical implementations while studying "Logic Design and Verification Using SystemVerilog". I'm documenting my learning journey and implementations of the concepts from the book.

## Structure

Each directory corresponds to specific chapters or topics, containing:
- Source code (`.sv` files)
- Testbenches
- Documentation
- Simulation outputs

## Usage

Each exercise is self-contained and includes necessary documentation for implementation and testing.
